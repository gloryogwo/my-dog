  <h1>Welcome to Glory's Pet Page (DOG)</h1>
  <p>The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. The dog derived from an ancient, extinct wolf, with the modern grey wolf being the dog's nearest living relative. The dog was the first species to be domesticated, by hunter-gatherers over 15000 years ago, before the development of agriculture.</p>
